		<p>My name is Elsy, I'm 23 at the moment and super excited to be the University of Houston. This campus is huge!<wbr>
			At first it was overwhelming at first but trying to get into different clubs and meeting new people I've grown used to it. 
			Im currently in the Marines ROTC program, I joined the comics club and the biking club as well and I have friends who go to 
			the Baptist church on campus. <br /> A fun fact about me is that I decided to switch majors this past summer from Dentristy 
			to Digital media with my focus towardsgaming and simulation design. I know those are really different programs, but I wasn't 
			really happy in what I was studying. I was really doing it for other reasons, more than anything I was doing it because I was 
			afraid that pursuing a career in art or game related fields wouldn't get me anywhere. To a certain extent I regret not sticking
			with what I grew up doing but at the same time I'm happy with the way victories and hardships have shaped me.</p>

		<h2>What am I doing now & what will I do in the future?</h2>
			<p>As of now, I'm a registered dental assistant and part time musician. I also love illustrating 
				and following people like Qiniiart (<a href="https://www.insc'[tagram.com/qinniart/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link
				to her instagram) and Variant Comic Book Covers (<a href="http://variantcomicscovers.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link the their tumblr page.)
			<br />I find it hard to express <i>how</i> excited I am for what I will be doing in the future. I can't wait, I want to graduate and 
				find a job in what I dreamed I could be doing some day. Even before I chose this career I would have sketchbooks full of random
				skits and minature comics. Now that I'm looking towards that field, I try to fill up my pages with body poses and refrences, sketches,
				notes and Ideas about things that I could create through Adobe illustrator (like the lady with the red hair) Or photoshop and 
				many other creative programs I'll be learning. Honestly, posting my work is my biggest challenge. But for the sake 
				of this website I have uploaded some sketches on my <a href="https://merasesi.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">deviantart</a> page. 
				and I've also attached some images to show you what my art style is like.</p>

			<h2><center>I'm engaged!</center></h2>
			<p>To many dreams, aspirations... and an amazing man! Who makes me really really happy. He's funny, silly, sensitive, and supportive.
			He inspires me, makes me a better person, and has this incredible way of seeing people. I love the way he has grown, and he keeps
			amazing me. He reminds me of things that God has done for me, and I want to be by his side helping him, loving him, supporting
			and growing with him. We met in our senior year of high school, and honestly, I was not interested- but he was so 
			persistent! And patient with me. I made him wait for about 3 years? (I know I was kinda mean! But I had to make sure! >.< ) 
			When I finally gave him a chance he proved to me to be worth all of my best effort, and love. Now- I just
			can't get enough of him. There is no wedding date yet but we can't wait to start our lives together, work, and 
			travel to Japan!</p>

			<h2><center>I really enjoy performing and writing music</center></h2>
				<p>Every now and then I'll work on a song that I wrote and try to put it in english or spanish. <i>What a Beautiful Name</i> was one of
					of the songs I worked on a while ago, <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AvZW4yViiZ3cgeJFO2KW5Rkr66zDIQ" target="_blank">this</a> is what I
					was able to come up with a few years ago. It was really rewarding to complete and perform it at church with our band. As of now were 
					four people, my little brother (right) sings lead, Allan (left) is lead guitar, sound guy and coordinator;
					Paulina (not in the picture) is vocals, and photography; I play drums and sing a little. Originally, this song is by Brooke 
					Ligertwood, I posted it below if you'd like to give it a listen.
					I'm also going to share some covers our band did of a few songs, check them out below!</p>

			<p>In size and age! In total, I have about eleven siblings. Three are older than I (on my moms side); four are younger
			than I (we are my mom and dads kids). The other three are youngsters from my stepmom and dads side. One of my sisters 
			is also due around March or April of next year! It's a girl! And we all can't wait to see what she'll be like 
			(I honestly think she will come out exactly like her moma -.-) and what the future has in store for her.
			<br />But hey, Would you like to have a small soccer team as well?! Take a look at the table below, these are just 
			my humble (unprofessional) opinions on what I feel a parent will go through and need!</p>
