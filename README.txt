The file "HTML Project Preview" Is the one you want to go for first.
Please Extract the files first, because I tried to preview it from the 
folder and it wouldn't display properly. 

I also tried to publish this project as a website but I coudn't afford 
to give it more time (math tests coming up) to tidy it up.
It looks really bad but it has the same content, The CSS part was hard to figure out. 
If you'd like to see it,
